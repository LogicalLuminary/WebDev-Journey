Core Web Vitals are a set of key performance metrics by Google that measure real-world user experience on websites. The three main metrics are:

LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) – Measures loading performance. Aim: LCP < 2.5s

FID (First Input Delay) – Measures interactivity. Aim: FID < 100ms
(Replaced by INP - Interaction to Next Paint in 2024)

CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) – Measures visual stability. Aim: CLS < 0.1

These vitals help ensure your website is fast, responsive, and stable for users.
